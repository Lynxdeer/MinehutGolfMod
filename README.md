# Minehut Golf Mod <br>
A garbage forge mod for minehut golf, I guess. If you feel like commenting that my code is garbage, feel free to do so, maybe I'll change it to be less garbage.

## Features
- Tells you your pitch and yaw <br>

*please suggest ideas for stuff I can do with this mod I don't have any*

## Download
*(might make a fabric port if I feel up to it sometime, but for now just forge)* <br>
