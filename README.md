# Minehut Golf Mod <br>
A garbage forge mod for minehut golf, I guess. If you feel like commenting that my code is garbage, feel free to do so, maybe I'll change it to be less garbage.

## Features
- Tells you your pitch and yaw *(togglable with the 0 key)*<br>
*no, you can't change it, you have to use the 0 key because I cba to figure out how custom hotkeys work*
- Allows you to use a TAS to get a high score<br>
Press R to load the next position, type -t (command) to use tas commands (or use /t help to see tas commands)
- Allows you to manually change your pitch and yaw<br>
Type -sp (pitch) or -sy (yaw) to change your pitch and yaw manually.

*please suggest ideas for stuff I can do with this mod I don't have any*

## Download
*(might make a fabric port if I feel up to it sometime, but for now just forge)* <br>
